Scan Types:

- Ping Scan [-sP]
  This scan lists the hosts within the specified range that responded to a ping. It allows you to detect which computers are online, rather than which ports are open. The first method sends an ICMP ECHO REQUEST (ping request) packet to the destination system. If an ICMP ECHO REPLY is received, the system is up, and ICMP packets are not blocked. If there is no response to the ICMP ping, Nmap will try a "TCP Ping", to determine whether ICMP is blocked, or if the host is really not online. A TCP Ping sends either a SYN or an ACK packet to any port (80 is the default) on the remote system. If RST, or a SYN/ACK, is returned, then the remote system is online. If the remote system does not respond, either it is offline, or the chosen port is filtered, and thus not responding to anything. When you run an Nmap ping scan as root, the default is to use the ICMP and ACK methods. Non-root users will use the connect() method. The ICMP scan type can be disabled by setting -P0 (-P'ZERO').

- TCP Connect() Scan [-sT]
  This is the most basic form of scanning that uses the UNIX connect command to attempt to connect to a port. If the connection succeeds, the port is open, if it fails, the system is offline, the port is closed, or an error occurred. This type of scan is easy to detect and will likely be logged in the target system.

- TCP Stealth Scan [-sS]
  SYN or Stealth scanning works by sending a SYN packet and looking at the response. If SYN/ACK is sent back, the port is open and the remote end is trying to open a TCP connection. The scanner then sends an RST to tear down the connection before it can be established fully; often preventing the connection attempt appearing in application logs. If the port is closed, an RST will be sent. If it is filtered, the SYN packet will have been dropped and no response will be sent. In this way, Nmap can detect three port states - open, closed and filtered. Modern firewalls and Intrusion Detection Systems can typically detect SYN scans, but in combination with other features of Nmap, it is possible to create a virtually undetectable SYN scan by altering timing and other options.

- UDP Scan [-sU]
  This scan sends 0-byte UDP packets to each target port on the victim unless --data, --data-length, or --data-string is specified. Receipt of an ICMP Port Unreachable message signifies the port is closed, otherwise it is assumed open. One major problem with this technique is that, when a firewall blocks outgoing ICMP Port Unreachable messages, the port will appear open. These false-positives are hard to distinguish from real open ports. Another disadvantage with UDP scanning is the speed at which it can be performed. Most operating systems limit the number of ICMP Port Unreachable messages which can be generated in a certain time period, thus slowing the speed of a UDP scan. Nmap adjusts its scan speed accordingly to avoid flooding a network with useless packets. An interesting point to note here is that Microsoft do not limit the Port Unreachable error generation frequency.

- SCTP Scan [-sY]
  SCTP is a relatively new alternative to the TCP and UDP protocols, combining most characteristics of TCP and UDP, and also adding new features like multi-homing and multi-streaming. SCTP INIT scan is the SCTP equivalent of a TCP SYN scan. It also allows clear, reliable differentiation between the open, closed, and filtered states. This technique is often referred to as half-open scanning, because you don't open a full SCTP association. You send an INIT chunk, as if you are going to open a real association and then wait for a response. An INIT-ACK chunk indicates the port is listening (open), while an ABORT chunk is indicative of a non-listener. If no response is received after several retransmissions, the port is marked as filtered. The port is also marked filtered if an ICMP unreachable error (type 3, code 0, 1, 2, 3, 9, 10, or 13) is received.

- FIN, XMAS, and NULL Scan [-sF, -sX, -sN]
  The FIN scan sends a packet with only the FIN flag set, the Xmas Tree scan sets the FIN, URG and PUSH flags and the Null scan sends a packet with no flags switched on. With the multitude of modern firewalls and IDS’ now looking out for SYN scans, these three scan types may be useful to varying degrees. Each scan type refers to the flags set in the TCP header. The idea behind these type of scans is that a closed port should respond with an RST upon receiving packets, whereas an open port should just drop them. This way, you never make even part of a connection, and never send a SYN packet; which is what most IDS’ look out for.

- IP Protocol Scan [-sO]
  The IP Protocol Scans attempt to determine the IP protocols supported on a target. Nmap sends a raw IP packet without any additional protocol header to each protocol on the target machine. Receipt of an ICMP Protocol Unreachable message tells us the protocol is not in use, otherwise it is assumed open. Not all hosts send ICMP Protocol Unreachable messages. These may include firewalls, AIX, HP-UX and Digital UNIX. These machines will report all protocols open. This scan type also falls victim to the ICMP limiting rate described in the UDP scans section, however since only 256 protocols are possible it should not take too long.

- Idle Scan [sI]
  Idle scanning is an advanced, highly stealthy technique, where no packets are sent to the target which can be identified to originate from the scanning machine. A zombie host (and optionally port) must be specified for this scan type. The zombie host must satisfy certain criteria essential to the workings of this scan. This scan type works by exploiting "predictable IP fragmentation ID" sequence generation on the zombie host, to determine open ports on the target. The scan checks the IPID on the zombie, then spoofs a connection request to the target machine, making it appear to come from the zombie. If the target port is open, a SYN/ACK session acknowledgement will be sent from the target machine back to the zombie, which will RST the connection since it has no record of having opened such a connection. If the port on the target is closed, an RST will be sent to the zombie, and no further packets will be sent. The attacker then checks the IPID on the zombie again. If it has incremented by 2, this corresponds to the packet received from the target, plus the RST from the zombie, which equates to an open port on the target. If the IPID has changed by one step, an RST was received from the target and no further packets were sent. Using this mechanism, it is possible to scan every port on a target, whilst making it appear that the zombie was the one doing the scanning. Of course, the spoofed connection attempts will likely be logged, so the target system will have the zombie IP address, and the zombie system’s logs are likely to contain the attacker’s IP address, so it is still possible, after acquiring logs through legal channels, to determine the attacker, but this method makes it much more difficult to do so than if the packets were sent directly from the attacker. In addition, some IDS and firewall software makes attempts to detect spoofed packets based on the network they arrive from. As long as the zombie host and the attacker are both "out on the Internet", or on the same network as each other, relative to the target, techniques to identify spoofed packets are not likely to succeed. This scan type requires certain things of the zombie. The IPID sequence generation must be predictable. The host must also have low traffic so that it is unlikely for other packets to hit the zombie whilst Nmap is carrying out its scan which will change the IPID number. Cheap routers or MS Windows boxes make good zombie hosts. Most operating systems use randomized sequence numbers (see the OS Fingerprinting section for details on how to check a target’s sequence generation type). The idle scan can also be used to determine IP trust based relationships between hosts such as a firewall that lets certain hosts connect, but not others. This scan type can help to determine which hosts have access to such a system. For more information about this scan type, read http://www.insecure.org/nmap/idlescan.html

- ACK Scan [-sA]
  Usually used to map firewall rulesets and distinguish between stateful and stateless firewalls, this scan type sends ACK packets to a host. If an RST comes back, the port is classified "unfiltered" (that is, it was allowed to send its RST through whatever firewall was in place). If nothing comes back, the port is said to be "filtered". That is, the firewall prevented the RST coming back from the port. This scan type can help determine if a firewall is stateless or stateful and tracks connections and also blocks unsolicited ACK packets.


Version and Service Options:

- Version Detection Scan [-sV]
  Version Detection collects information about the specific service running on an open port, including the product name and version number. This information can be critical in determining an entry point for an attack. Version detection is based on a complex series of probes, detailed in the Version Detection paper at http://www.insecure.org/nmap/vscan/

- Version Intensity [--version-intensity <intensity>]
  When performing a version scan , Nmap sends a series of probes, each of which is assigned a rarity value between one and nine. The lower-numbered probes are effective against a wide variety of common services, while the higher-numbered ones are rarely useful. The intensity level specifies which probes should be applied. The higher the number, the more likely it is the service will be correctly identified. However, high intensity scans take longer. The intensity must be between 0 and 9. The default is 7. When a probe is registered to the target port via the nmap-service-probes ports directive, that probe is tried regardless of intensity level. This ensures that the DNS probes will always be attempted against any open port 53, the SSL probe will be done against 443, etc.
